                    “quill clubbers.” Whether you're planning a casual local meet-and-greet, a virtual webinar

                    to make it easy. If you are unsure where to start, we would reccomend a virtual 
                    meet-and-greet. This has been a favorite of many quill clubbers allowing the sharing of 
                    funy moments and tips and tricks for all temperments of hedgehog. contact us here to see 
                    what other fun activities may be planned, or that you would like to host! Let's build 
                    lasting friendships and create a supportive, vibrant community—one quill at a time!

                <p>
                    Meet Miss Pipoca! She is a two year old white African Pygmy Hedgehog with snowflake patterned 
                    quills. Her favorite pastimes include napping, running on her wheel, eating bugs, exploring 
                    everywhere, and attacking hair. Pipoca has a sassy can do attitude with a stubborn streak. She 
                    is very set in her ways of how her cage needs to be arranged and will fix it if it is not 
                    perfect. Pipoca loves to meet new friends and watch action shows.
