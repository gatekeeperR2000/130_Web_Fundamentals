                <h1>Hedgehogs</h1>
                <p>Hedgehogs are naturally nocturnal and prefer to sleep during the day. African Pygmy Hedgehogs 
                    need to stay in the temperature range of 70 to 85 degrees. If they get to cold they could go 
                    into hibernation and die. Hedgehogs can run up to 10 miles or more a night! Having wheels in 
                    their enclosure is important for them to stay active! Hedgehogs are also prone to get diabetes 
                    because they love to eat! Their wheels and portion control help prevent this. Most heggies 
                    love to cuddle and snuggle up to you! They like hoodie pockets, necks, and inside your shirts! 
                    Overall, hedgehogs are a low maintenance fun loving pet!</p>
