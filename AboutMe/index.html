        <p>
            Hello all, my name is Rylan and I am here studying Computer Engineering.
            I got married about one year ago and enjoy relaxing at home with my wife
            after a long day of school and work.
        </p>

        <p>
            For now I just work as a TA here on campus, and sadly haven't had much luck with internships,
            and don't really know where I want to go after this. I am considering going into a PHD program
            and seeing if my future lies in research or teaching.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am taking this course to learn a little more about a different aspect of programming and the computer world.
            And to get me up to 12 credits so I qualify for a few of the internships I am applying to. I hope to be able
            to better understand more about how computers work and comunicate and think that the knowledge of how websites function
            could be interesting to know.
